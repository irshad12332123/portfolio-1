        Hello! I am Md Irshad, a passionate web developer with a love for creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites.

        <p>
          I specialize in frontend technologies like <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and modern frameworks such as <strong>React.js</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>. My goal is always to build responsive, high-performance web applications that provide excellent user experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the past few years, I have worked on a variety of projects, ranging from simple landing pages to full-stack web applications. I am always eager to learn new technologies and continuously improve my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time, I love exploring new tech, contributing to open-source projects, and writing technical blogs to share my knowledge with the community.
        </p>

        <p>
          My approach to work is simple: <em>Write clean code, build with passion, and always focus on the user!</em>
